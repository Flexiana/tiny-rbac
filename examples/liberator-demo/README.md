Because it's just a quick example, there are no tests included.

| method | path | result |
|---|---|---|
| GET    | localhost:3000                                    | welcome screen                                     |
| GET    | localhost:3000/user/{{user-id}}/posts             | All posts and comments which visible for the user  |
| GET    | localhost:3000/user/{{user-id}}/posts/{{post-id}} | One post and comments if it's visible for the user |
| PUT    | localhost:3000/user/{{user-id}}/posts             | Creates a post if the user has the ability         |
| POST   | localhost:3000/user/{{user-id}}/posts/{{post-id}} | Updates a post if the user has the ability   |
| DELETE | localhost:3000/user/{{user-id}}/posts/{{post-id}} | Deletes a post if the user has the ability   |

When a user is not permitted to make an action, by its role or on a given post, then the response status is 403: Forbidden 

### Creating and updating a post

From postman the body should be `x-www-form-urlencoded`. 

The used fields are:
- content
- visible

If the visible parameter is not set, then it's defaults to `public`.
